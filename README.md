# BootSC: Bootstrap Spectral Clustering by Deep Neural Networks

BootSC is an online deep spectral clustering framework. This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of BootSC along with training scripts and utility functions.

## Usage:

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BootSC-5B1B
    
Install dependencies:

    cd BootSC-5B1B
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Preparation: 
Both the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets will be automatically downloaded and prepared during training. 
As for the ImageNet-10, ImageNet Dogs, and Tiny ImageNet datasets, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2021-AAAI-CC) for downloading and configuring.
By default, BootSC utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset and you can alse choose specific datasets by modifying the `dataset_name` variable in the script (Line 147 in BootSC.py)ï¼š
````
dataset_name = ['cifar10', 'cifar100', 'imagenet10', 'imagenet_dogs', 'tiny_imagenet'][2] # for ImageNet-10
````


Training: Run the training script by executing:

    python train.py
